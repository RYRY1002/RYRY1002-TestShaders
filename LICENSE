# License

I'm editing the following shaders for educational purposes. You can find their Licenses below.

## Ebin Shaders

(Updated as of 1/10/2020)
### Informal
Do not redistribute Ebin, or a derivative of Ebin, without our explicit permission.

We will probably allow you to release an Ebin edit if it contains substantial contributions. Continuum to SEUS is a good example of "substantial contributions" to a shaderpack.

I better not see Ebin re-hosted on a site like 9minecraft.net.

### Formal
Ebin are the intellectual property of Bruce Z. and Joseph Conover (here and hereafter referred to as 'The Ebin Team') and the copyright belongs to them.

You are granted the right to use and modify Ebin and its source for your own personal use.

It is, however, interdicted to (re-)distribute Ebin as it is provided or in any modified version in parts or in its entirety in any way without explicit written permission by The Ebin Team. You may ipso facto not create mirrors, use parts of Ebin - including snippets from its source code - in your own work, claim to be the author of Ebin or publish derived shader packs under your own or Ebin's name.

You may freely publish Minecraft footage with Ebin installed given that you do not infringe applicable law. If you feature Ebin as the main content, you must provide reference to a description of Ebin as found in the official source on the github.

Should you opt to release a subsequent series of videos that do not feature Ebin as their main content, e.g. 'Let's plays', it is sufficient to provide this reference once in the first installment featuring Ebin or its corresponding description.

This software is provided 'as is' and comes without warranty of any kind including, but not limited to, the implied warranty that it works the way intended or advertised. In no event is The Ebin Team liable to you for any damage that arises out of the use or malfunction of Ebin including, but not limited to, hardware failure, loss of income and negative impact on your Minecraft experience. The entire risk as to every aspect of Ebin is with you.

This agreement shall be generally referred to as the 'Ebin License'. The Ebin Team is free to change this license at any point in time without further notice. You can always find the latest version on https://github.com/BruceKnowsHow/Ebin-Shaders

Legal domicile for any disputes arising from or in connection with Ebin or its use is Nevada, USA or California, USA. Each clause of this agreement is subject to applicable law and only to be applied to the extent is permitted by applicable law.

In case any part of this agreement should for any reason be considered invalid, illegal or be deemed unenforceable, The Ebin Team shall undertake to replace the aforementioned part by a term that comes closest to the intended meaning and is all valid, legal and enforceable. The remaining parts of this agreement are therefrom unaffected in their validity.

By installing, downloading, storing a copy of or using Ebin you agree to all of the terms and conditions. They can and will, if deemed neccessary by The Ebin Team, be enforced by going to law.

For further questions concerning Ebin, its use or this license please contact The Ebin Team on GitHub.
